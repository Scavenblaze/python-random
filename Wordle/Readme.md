Wordle game using python  
  
How to play:  
You have 6 chances to guess a 5 lettered word.  
Whenever you type a valid word, it will give you hints about the word based on your guess. Hints are:  
- "letter" represents the correct position of your guessed letter
- "1" represents that the guessed letter is correct but the position of the letter is wrong.
- "_" represents that the guessed letter is wrong.
When the game ends, the correct word is revealed and the program asks you if you want to play again or not.
