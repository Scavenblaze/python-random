Pong game created using Turtle.  
I have used winsound to play sounds (that I have made) whenever the ball hits the paddle or if any player wins the game.  
It has a scoring system that keeps track of player scores.  
Thank you @vwani for testing this game.  
  
###PATCHES:
> Patch v1:  Released the game.  
[+] Added sounds if either player wins and when the ball hits the paddle  
[+] Added scoring system  
Known issues: paddle movement is slow or needs repeated key pressing to move it.
